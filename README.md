# Finding Sites for Marine Aquaculture based on their suitable depth and temperature levels


Marine aquaculture has the potential to play an important role in the global food supply as a more sustainable protein option than land-based meat production. This repo attempts to maximize the benefit of marine aquaculture by mapping commercial marine animals to their most preferred depth and temperature levels in the West Coast. We will first look in Suiteable Oyster sites, and then expand our methods to create suitable area maps for any given species with their ideal temperature and depth range.
